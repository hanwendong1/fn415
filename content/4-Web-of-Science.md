#### Citation Chaining

Citation chaining is a research technique in which you use one source to find related documents.

There are two types of citation chaining:

- Forward Chaining - Starting with one work and looking at the works that have cited the current work as a reference. 
- Backward Chaining - Looking at what documents the current work cites and then following those backward by looking at the documents they cite.

In a Web of Science record, you can click `Citations` for forward chaining and `References` for backward chaining.
