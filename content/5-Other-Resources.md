Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. Search across a wide variety of disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts, etc. Click [this link](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://scholar.google.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to access Google Scholar. Note that not everything in Google Scholar is scholarly. Google Scholar searches academic websites (.edu) as well as journals and publisher websites. Search results can include powerpoints, news announcements or unpublished materials as well as articles and books. 

You can access the advanced search by clicking the three lines on the top left corner.

Similar to Web of Science, you can use citation chaining. Clicking `cited by` would allow you to find all the other sources citing the article you found on Google Scholar.
