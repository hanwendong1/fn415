### What is This Website for?
I created this website for students enrolled in Animal and Veterinary Science 463 *Growth and Lactation* class. The assignment requires identifying a topic for current topic debate and gathering research information (consumerâ€™s perception of the subject as well as scientific-based knowledge) that either supports or refutes the issue. Possible topics include: 
- Use of bST (growth hormone) to increase milk production
- Low-fat vs. whole milk consumption
- Organic vs. conventional farming
- Consumption of animal milk vs. plant-based milk
- Antibiotic use on farm
- Consumption of pasteurized milk vs. raw milk
- Contribution of dairy industry to greenhouse gases
- Separation of dairy cow from calf

### Learning Outcomes
After reviewing the contents of this guide, you will be able to:
1. Apply Boolean logic to search strategy
2. Select journals and databases for research in dairy science
3. Find popular and scholarly sources on chosen topic
4. Evaluate and revise search strategy based on search results
